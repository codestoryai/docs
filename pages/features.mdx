## ✍ ️ Commit message helper

Writing good commit messages is hard — we do half the work by speaking about the 'what', so you can focus on the 'why'.

**How to access:** In the sidebar extension, click on the _COMMIT_ button when you're ready to commit your changes. You can then select the files you want to commit and write your commit message.

## 🪄 One-click migration from VSCode

All your VSCode settings & extensions can be imported in a single step.

**How to access:** See the [getting started guide](/onboarding#importing-vscode-settings) for more details.
