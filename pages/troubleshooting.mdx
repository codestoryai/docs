## Installation warnings

### Unidentified developer
MacOS has a long process for certifying developers and ensuring each build that is released is signed by the developer. We already have a valid certificate from them and go through the "notarization" process for each build. But occasionally, we've seen a warning show up for some users that says "Aide can't be opened because the identity of the developer cannot be confirmed". In such cases, you can follow these steps to open the app:

1. The first time you see the pop-up, there is no option to open the app. Click OK.
<p align="center" style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
	<img
	src="images/installation/unknown_developer.png"
	alt="Unknown developer"
	/>
</p>

2. Once the pop-up is closed, open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy. You will see a block under 'Security' which says '"Aide" was blocked from use because the identity of the developer cannot be confirmed.'. Choose 'Open Anyway'.
<p align="center" style={{ margin: "1.5rem" }}>
	<img
	src="images/installation/security_settings.png"
	alt="Security settings"
	/>
</p>

3. You will see a pop-up asking you to confirm that you want to open the app. Click Open.

<p align="center" style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
	<img
	src="images/installation/allow_developer.png"
	alt="Allow developer"
	/>
</p>

### App downloaded from the internet
MacOS issues a standard warning when an app is downloaded from the internet rather than their App Store. This is not specific to Aide. The first time you open the app, you will be prompted to confirm that you want to open the app. After that, you can open the app normally.

<p align="center" style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
	<img
	src="images/installation/open_confirmation.png"
	alt="Open confirmation"
	/>
</p>
