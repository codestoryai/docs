# How to install extensions

Currently, we point to the Open VSX Registry for extensions. This is a community-driven, open-source registry of VS Code extensions. You can find more information about it [here](https://open-vsx.org/). If any of your favourite extensions don't show up here, you can still install them on Aide by following the instructions below.

## Installing extensions from the VS Code Marketplace

1. Go to the VS Code Marketplace and search for the extension you want to install.
