## Known limitations

At this point in time, a lot of the core functionality is implemented as a VSCode extension. The extension comes pre-installed with Aide, but it has the following limitations:

1. The extension will not open until a JS/TS project is opened in the workspace.
2. If a large project is opened, the extension might take a while to load since the indexing process is currently synchronous.
3. Before running any CodeStory commands, the extension needs to be explicitly activated by clicking on the CodeStory icon in the VSCode status bar.

## Importing VSCode settings

Aide supports importing all your settings and extensions from VSCode. In order to do so,

1. Open a JS/TS project folder.
